### Pyshark

- packetprocessor can be heavily modified / stripped iff so, or just write new extractors xD
- rest should be widely uneffected, put pyshark output into queues -> happy
- flying with diving gear

### perform experiments

- need to parse packets head during capture to notice CBR and trigger further actions -> easy
- save samples with metainfo ( classes, domain ) in extra file
